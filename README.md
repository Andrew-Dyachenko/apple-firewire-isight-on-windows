# Apple FireWire iSight on Windows

This repository preserves all known working (and partially working) FireWire (IEEE 1394) drivers for Windows ‚Äî  
collected from **Unibrain** and **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)** websites.  
It exists as an **archival project** to ensure that Apple FireWire iSight and other IEEE 1394 cameras  
remain usable even if the original sources someday disappear.

## üí° Purpose

This project was created primarily for enthusiasts who still use the legendary **Apple iSight FireWire camera (2003)**  
on modern Windows systems.  

All drivers are stored here **as-is**, unmodified and unaltered, exactly as they were distributed by their authors.  
I did not modify, recompile, or patch any of the files ‚Äî only gathered them for long-term preservation.

## üß© Included Drivers

### From **Unibrain**
Source: [https://www.unibrain.com/downloads/](https://www.unibrain.com/downloads/)

- ubCore‚Ñ¢ 6.00 (32-bit / 64-bit)
- ubCore‚Ñ¢ 6.00 Pro (32-bit / 64-bit)
- ubCore‚Ñ¢ 5.8 Pro (64-bit)
- FireAPI‚Ñ¢, Fire-i API‚Ñ¢, Fire-i X‚Ñ¢ SDKs (evaluation versions)
- Fire-i‚Ñ¢ 4.0 drivers & control application (32-bit / 64-bit)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Unibrain ubCore drivers may cause system instability (BSOD)  
**only when used with Apple FireWire iSight camera on Windows 10 x64**.  
They should work properly on older Windows versions such as XP, Vista, 7, and 8.  
This does **not** mean Unibrain‚Äôs software is faulty ‚Äî the issue is specific to this combination of hardware and OS.

### From **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)**
Source: [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/downloads/index.html](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/downloads/index.html)

- CMU 1394 Digital Camera Driver versions **4.1 ‚Üí 6.4.6** (including signed, unsigned, and beta builds)
- Installation utilities and source code archives

## üß† Compatibility

These drivers were **tested by me personally on Windows 10 64-bit**.  
Earlier Windows versions (XP, Vista, 7, 8) are officially listed as supported by Unibrain and CMU,  
so they should also be compatible in theory ‚Äî but I have not tested them myself.

## üß∞ Practical usage notes

For the **CMU 1394 driver (6.4.6 signed)**, the Apple iSight FireWire camera produces a correct image  
with balanced brightness and contrast.  

If you use the **Microsoft 1394 Legacy driver**, the image may appear overexposed,  
though it works in more applications (OBS, Telegram, etc.).  

To use the CMU driver effectively:
- Open the `1394Camera Demo` application that comes with it  
- Capture its window via **OBS Studio**
- Enable **OBS Virtual Camera**
- Select it in **Telegram**, **WhatsApp Desktop**, **Zoom**, or any other video chat app.

It‚Äôs not the most convenient setup, but it‚Äôs a small price to pay for bringing a 2003 FireWire camera back to life in 2025!
